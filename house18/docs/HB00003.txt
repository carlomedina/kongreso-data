‘This proposed bill underscores the fact that while our child-caring institutions receive
‘support from public and private sources, there is a need to address the orphaned, abandoned,
neglected, or voluntary commited child’s need for assistance in securing a bright and better futur.
If nobody ean do this for ther, the Government as parens patriae must step In and perform this
task.

‘This measure seeks to provide for a trust fund account for each orphaned, abandoned,
neglected, or voluntary committed minor under DSWD-accredited child caring institutions and care
centers which the State has to fund by quarterly depositing a specified amount for each ofthe trust
fund account, The trust fund account matures when the orphaned, abandoned, neglected, or
voluntary committed minor reaches the age of majority, and thus providing him or her seed money
to face the challenges of if and pursue his or her dreams.

In the best interests of our abandoned, neglected, or voluntary committed children, the
carly approval ofthis billis earnestly sought.
